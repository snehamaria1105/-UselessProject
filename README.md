# AUNTY RADAR üéØ

### by
- Sneha Maria - LBSITW


### Project Description
Aunty Radar is a light, interactive web app that helps you find safer, more judgment-free walking paths by avoiding the infamous "aunty zones"‚Äîthose places where you're likely to be judged for simply existing.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too many "aunties" judging you for what you wear, who you‚Äôre with, or how late you're out.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A location-based route system that helps you choose the aunty-safe path‚Äîbecause your business is your business.
